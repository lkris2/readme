I initially embarked on a journey as a pre-med enthusiast, deeply committed to the field of medicine. However, a pivotal moment occurred when a class project, initially a simple academic endeavor, evolved into a community service initiative. This transformation marked the birth of my passion for computer science. It was during this process that I discovered my knack for debugging and resurrecting malfunctioning code, persistently working until it achieved a state of perfection. This experience solidified my dedication to the world of computer science, and I've since evolved into a passionate programmer. I proudly earned the 2nd Best Project award at the UIC Spark Hacks Hackathon for co-creating a Social Networking App. My proficiency extends across multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java, and I've delved into web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

My diverse experiences, including a role as a Research Assistant at UIC College of Engineering and a Web Development Internship at Tech Citi in Bangalore, have honed my skills in areas like NLI models, HTML, CSS, and audio/video integration. I find joy in crafting interactive experiences, exemplified by my work on projects like the Multiplayer Poker Game, and have a deep passion for creating secure and user-friendly applications, as evident in my contributions to the Social Networking App.
